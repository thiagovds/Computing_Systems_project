3.1 System specifications
  The main goal of the system is autonomous and reliable medicine storing and dispensing: it must dispense a set amount of pills (1 or more 
  depending on the dosage required) following the medical schedule of the patient; for such purpose it requires internet connectivity, through 
  which the scedule can be uploaded, but at the same time it has to store the minimum data locally to ensure a few hours of backup in case of 
  a power outage. In case of "heavy mental/physical issues" the role of caregivers or relatives is necessary to refill the system's magazine 
  and to set remotely the medication schedule. Aside from the delivery, the system is packed with reminders for both the user (buzzer/alarm when
  it's pill time, LED light to showcase which magazine is delivering) and the caregiver (warning notification in case of dispense failure or short 
  supply of pills). Another big requirement is a low production price and high scalability, which makes the system more competitive and more 
  available; while high electrical efficiency is not mandatory as the system is not meant to be carried around.
3.2 General architecture
  The minimum configuration is comprehensive of a brain cell connected to the first dispenser, and all the other magazine required can be added 
  side by side; the brain cell manages all the computation required through a microcontroller, and the internet connection is achieved through a ESP8266 
  module. Aside from storing the medical schedule of the patient and driving the mechanics of the device, the microcontroller Arduino Uno Rev 3 manages the
  notification system for both the user and the associated relative or caregiver.
  The single magazine is activated by 2 servomotors, which work in tandem to guarantee a reliable dispensing action: the first let the pill drop into the 
  user's hand, while the other holds the successive pills and prevent them from being dispensed. A photointerrupter at the and of the chain check for 
  correct operation of the dispenser. Being the system modular, 2 transceiver are featured inside every magazine, thus to allow the daisy chaining of the 
  various compartments required by the medical necessities of the patient. Each module shares the same working mechanism, but the dimension of the single 
  container depends on the size of medication that has to be dispensed. Following the Capsule Size Guide, the dispensers are designed to serve the most 
  consumed pills.
