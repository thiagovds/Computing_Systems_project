The first and still most common solution to safe medicine delivering is pill organizers,
simple containers divided in compartments to differentiate different pills. The most advanced
of such devices can lock or unlock the various compartments on a time-based scheduled set 
by the users, and consequently remind the patient which pill has to be taken. Even if the risk 
of assuming wrong medicines during a day is mostly mitigated, the organizer requires daily 
refilling by a caregiver or relative of the patient.
