Problem: Sorting pills is a repetitive and delicate task, requiring what's called prospective memory, 
         a form of memory that involves remembering to perform a planned action or recall a planned 
         intention at some future point in time. This kind of memory gets worse with aging, so, for elderly,
         pills sorting needs to be performed by relatives or caregiver; in this way it's still 
         susceptible to the human error, which could lead to wrong dosages or medicine intake.

Solution: with RAPiD, this risk can be highly mitigated, bringing tranquility to your family and to the 
         ones you care about. It's a fully autonomous and reliable pill dispenser, which through the accompanying app,
         connects to the internet, from which it receives important data such as "precise time stamps"
         and once the connection is established, every new operation on the device will be done remotely.
         But apart from uploading new schedules and refilling the pills magazine (once requested by the dispenser
         itself), the RAPiD will works autonomously, helping its user to maintain a regular intake schedule.
         The device will alert the user with sounds and lights when it's time for intake, and after checking
         the presence of the user, it dispenses the set dosage of medicine. As more than 1 medicine might be
         required, the system is fully modular, and allows the relative/caregiver to add more magazines /modules, 
         each containing a different pill. At first glance this solution might seem expensive, but that's not the 
         case: the magazines are cheap, and you can buy just the number necessary for your needs.
         "Thanks to the clever design of the device, maintenance is cheap, but must be performed by trained personnel 
         to guarantee the functionality (and safety) of the device."
         But why would you want the RAPiD? 
	 As IT professors always say "computers are dumb, but once instructed, they are very good at repeting 
         operations over and over again" which is exactly what the device is meant to do.
         Once the setup is completed through the app, the caregiver or relative will receive information from 
         the device in the form of push notifications or email; this information include reminders when
         a magazine is running out of pills, warning messages in case the user missed the intake time, very rarely 
         messages about fails inside the device (kidding, we never had fails during testing :)  ).

Conclusions: this device is meant to help you by helping the people you care about, being them relatives or 
            patients under your care. It's reliable, it won't let you down even in the event of a power outage, 
            it's childproof and, of course, elderly-proof. Seems like all those features come at a very high price 
            but don't worry, it won't break the bank, and remember, you'll buy just what you need and nothing more. 
	    Thank you for the time and attention.
