// maybe here we need some data about elderly problems with medicine, overdosage and
the problem of very pricy solutions, why our product is cheaper and why it represent 
a step forward for this problem //

Our project is highly modular, consisting of a pill magazine and reliable delivery system,
in order to overcome the risk of overdosage. Multiple magazine can be stacked side by side, 
with only the "controller magazine" necessarily connected to wifi for remote control of the 
delivery schedule and to communicate via notification/email with a caregiver or relative.
The controller magazine will send a warning messagge everytime a pill is not delivered or taken 
properly on schedule.
The physical dimension of the pill determines the "type" of magazine needed, for better operation;
the pill is dispensed from the magazine through a sliding compartment and a load cell check the 
correct operation of the sliding mechanism; the magazine emittes a jingle when it's ready for delivery
and lights a LED to show which medicine needs to be taken.
